## An Interoperable Federation of EFFS services for European Open Science Cloud

### Pedro Ferreira (CERN)

## The Idea

![bg right horizontal 70%](assets/sciencemesh.svg)
![bg right vertical 50%](assets/cs3mesh4eosc.png)

 * **Decentralized** mesh of EFSS nodes
 * Based on **Open Standards** and **Open Source**
 * **Interoperable Platform** to easily share and deploy applications and components

## Objectives

![bg right 50%](assets/sciencemesh-alt.svg)

 * **Application platform** for distributed collaboration
 * **Federated** research space for Europe (and the world!)
 * Leveraging the potential of the **CS3 Community**

---

## EFSS Integration

### Objectives

 * Platform-specific plugins;
 * Implement "Invite workflow" from EFSS system;
 * A User Interface which feels seamless;

## EFSS Integration

![bg right 80%](assets/mockups-collab.png)

* Nextcloud
  - outsourced to PonderSource (alpha stage);
  - UX and backend;
* ownCloud
  - OCIS - using REVA, still UX work to do;
  - version 10 - backport by PonderSource (March 2022);
* Seafile
  - under discussion

---
## Federation

![bg vertical cover right:55%](assets/dashboard.png)

* Established Roadmap for Trust
* Federated Identity
* Registry (GOCDB, Mentix)
* Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
* Security
* **Up and running mid-2021!**

## Synergies

 * Conversations with several vendors about new features and integrations
   - e.g. sponsoring developments in **Rclone**
 * Open Data partnership involving UTS, PARADISEC (AU), Zenodo
   - Based on WWU's **Sciebo RDS** and UTS's **Describo**
